            <p> ICCP 2025 brings together researchers and practitioners from the multiple fields that computational imaging intersects: computational photography, computational optics, computational sensing, computational displays, computer vision, computer graphics, art, and design. We invite you to present your work to this broad audience during the ICCP poster and demo session. Whereas ICCP papers must describe original research, ICCP posters and demos give an opportunity to showcase previously-published or yet-to-be-published work to a broader community.</p>

            <p>The poster track is non-exclusive. All papers accepted at ICCP will have a poster reserved for them. The list of accepted and presented Posters and Demos will be announced on our conference website, which serves as a record of the presentation.</p>

            <p>We are now accepting submissions in the following categories:</p>
            
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Posters:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Recent research broadly related to computational imaging, previously published in another venue (conference or journal). This is your chance to present your work in person to a cross-section of the computational imaging community.</li>
                  <li>Late-breaking technical results and research, including, but not limited to, progress in computational algorithms, optical system design, and innovative applications.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Demos:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Demos of working computational imaging prototypes, computational displays, tools, software platforms, and/or imaging instrumentation utilizing computational imaging techniques, including both research and commercial systems.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
