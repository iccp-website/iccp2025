            <h3 class="subtitle">Two Integrated Paper Tracks</h3>
            <p>As in previous years, ICCP is coordinating with the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) for a special issue on Computational Photography to be published after the conference. All submissions to ICCP will undergo a common review process and be judged for acceptance to <em>either</em>:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The PAMI special issue: for papers that describe entirely novel work (i.e., not extensions of published conference papers) and are also of archival quality with comprehensive evaluation and analysis.</li>
              <li>The ICCP Proceedings: for papers that meet traditional conference criteria for quality and novelty but do not meet the criteria for (1) above.</li>
            </ol>
  
            <p>Reviewing will be double-blind, and authors will be allowed a rebuttal after initial reviews. After review, the program chairs will inform the authors of accepted papers whether their paper has been selected for the special issue or the conference proceedings (see the Review and Decision Process section below for further details). Both sets of accepted papers will be presented as talks at the conference.</p>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Papers must be submitted through CMT3.</li>
                <li>Submissions must be anonymized for double-blind review and prepared using the provided <a href="static/materials/iccp2025_latex_template.zip">LaTeX author kit</a>. Submitted versions should not include author names and biographies, or other information that may identify authors.</li>
                <li>Although there is no strict page limit for ICCP submissions, papers longer than 8 pages excluding references can only be accepted if their length is commensurate with their contributions. Papers whose total length exceeds 12 pages including references will be subject to a mandatory page charge of <em>$220 per page</em>. Papers longer than 18 pages can only be accepted to the conference paper track, not the PAMI special issue
                </li>
                <li>Papers can include supplementary material. This material must also be anonymized. Note that reviewers may, but are not required to, review the supplementary material.</li>
                <li><strong>For papers accepted to the PAMI special issue, authors will be notified of additional steps after the camera ready deadline for transfer to the PAMI publication team.</strong></li>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Review and Decision Process</h3>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Reviewing will be double-blind, and every valid submission will receive at least three expert reviews from members of the ICCP 2025 program committee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Authors will be given one week after reviews are released to prepare and submit an optional one-page rebuttal via CMT3 that responds to the reviews.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>After weighing the rebuttal and discussions with reviewers, program chairs will make one of the following decisions for every paper:                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Reject</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Conditionally Accept to Conference Proceedings</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Recommend for PAMI special issue</strong></li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Conditionally accepted papers and papers recommended for the PAMI special issue will be assigned a shepherd from the ICCP Program Committee. The shepherd will verify that reviewer requests are addressed in a revised version of the paper to be submitted by June 16. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Submissions recommended to the PAMI special issue may require additional minor revisions prior to final acceptance to PAMI, equivalent to a journal minor revision. <em>Revision requests that are not addressed satisfactorily will result in publication at the conference instead of PAMI.</em></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For both paper tracks, authors must upload their final papers to CMT3 by the camera ready deadline.</li>
                <li>For papers accepted to the PAMI special issue, authors will receive instructions for further processing by the IEEE Computer Society publications department.</li>

            <section id="policies">
            <h3 class="subtitle">Policies</h3>
            By submitting a paper to ICCP, authors agree to all policies. For any questions, please contact the program chairs by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:iccp-2025-chairs@googlegroups.com">iccp-2025-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>. 
            <br>
            <br>

              <p><strong>Institutional Conflicts:</strong> All authors of a submission must create an account on CMT3 if they do not already have one, and they must declare their institutional conflicts (click on your name in the upper-right and then “Domain Conflicts” under ICCP 2025). These should include domains of all institutions they have worked for or collaborated closely with within the last 3 years. Incorrect or undeclared conflicts may lead to administrative rejection. It is the primary author's responsibility to ensure that all authors are registered and that the submission uses the email addresses corresponding to their CMT3 accounts. </p>
              
              <p><strong>No changes to the author list will be allowed after the paper submission deadline.</strong></p>
              <br>



            <p><strong>Author Anonymity:</strong> ICCP reviewing is double-blind in that authors do not know the names of reviewers, and reviewers cannot, beyond a reasonable doubt, infer the authors' names from the submission and the additional material. Do not provide any information that may identify the authors, including in the acknowledgments and supplementary material. Do not provide links to websites that identify authors. Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to administrative rejection.</p> <br>

            <p><strong>Dual and Concurrent Submissions:</strong>  ICCP’s goal is to publish novel, exciting work and to prevent duplication of reviewing efforts. By submitting a manuscript to ICCP, authors acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue, including journal, conference,  workshop, or archival forum. Furthermore, <strong>no manuscript substantially similar in content (defined as having 20 percent or more overlap) has been or will be submitted to this or another conference, workshop, or journal during the ICCP review period</strong>. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection. If in doubt, authors are encouraged to include any related concurrent submissions, appropriately anonymized, in their supplementary materials. <br> <br>

              A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined as written work that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection and, after review, was accepted. In particular, this definition of publication does not depend upon whether such an accepted written work appears in a formal proceedings. Under the above definition, arXiv preprints and university technical reports are not considered publications. However, peer-reviewed workshop papers are considered publications, even if they do not appear in a proceedings.
              Note that a technical report (departmental, arXiv, etc.) version of the submission that is put up without any form of direct peer-review is NOT considered prior art and does NOT NEED to be cited in the submission; authors may cite such material, but cannot be penalized for not citing it.
              </p><br>
            <p><strong>Plagiarism:</strong> Plagiarism consists of appropriating the words or results of prior publications without proper attribution. ICCP 2025’s policy on plagiarism is to refer suspected cases to the IEEE Intellectual Property office, which has an established mechanism for dealing with plagiarism and broad powers of excluding offending authors from future conferences and from IEEE journals. You can find information on this office, their procedures, and their definitions of five levels of plagiarism at <a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/plagiarism.html">this webpage</a>.</p><br>
            <p><strong>LLM policy:</strong> Authors may use any tools they find productive in preparing a paper, but they are responsible for any misrepresentation, factual inaccuracy, or plagiarism. Papers containing citations of non-existent material or other obvious factual inaccuracies will be administratively rejected.</p>
