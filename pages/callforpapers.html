            <h3 class="subtitle">Two Integrated Paper Tracks</h3>
            <p>As in previous years, ICCP is coordinating with the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) for a special issue on Computational Photography to be published after the conference. All submissions to ICCP will undergo a common review process and be judged for acceptance to either:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The PAMI special issue: for papers that describe entirely novel work (i.e., not extensions of published conference papers) and are also of archival quality with comprehensive evaluation and analysis.</li>
              <li>The ICCP Proceedings: for papers that meet traditional conference criteria for quality and novelty but do not meet the criteria for (1) above.</li>
            </ol>
  
            <p>Reviewing will be double-blind, and authors will be allowed a rebuttal after initial reviews. After review, the program chairs will inform the authors of accepted papers whether their paper has been selected for the special issue or the conference proceedings (see the Review and Decision Process section below for further details). Both sets of accepted papers will be presented as talks at the conference.</p>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Reviewing will be double-blind, and every submission (except those rejected administratively) will receive at least three expert reviews.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>After the reviews are released to authors, they can respond with a rebuttal on CMT3 (submitted as a one-page PDF file in the same LaTeX format as for ICCP 2025 submission, but without title, author, and abstract sections). There will be no opportunity to revise the paper at that time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>After weighing the rebuttal and discussions with reviewers, program chairs will make one of the following decisions for every paper:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Reject</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Accept to Conference Proceedings</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Recommended to PAMI special issue</strong>. For papers in this category, program chairs may inform authors of suggested or required minor changes to be included in the camera-ready. This will be equivalent to a journal minor revision.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Authors will upload their final versions to CMT by the camera-ready deadline.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>At this time for papers in category 3 above, program chairs will verify (without further input from reviewers) that the camera-ready has included all required changes and is otherwise substantially similar to the reviewed version. If the camera-ready does not include the required changes, the paper may be moved to category 2 (i.e., Accept to Conference Proceedings). Otherwise, program chairs (as guest editors) will forward the recommendation that the paper be published in the special issue to the PAMI editor-in-chief.</em></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>For papers accepted to the PAMI special issue, authors will receive instructions for further processing by the IEEE Computer Society publications department.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Policies</h3>
            <p><strong>Conflict Responsibilities:</strong> The primary author must ensure that all authors on their paper have registered their institutional conflicts into CMT3. If a paper is found to have an undeclared or incorrect institutional conflict, the paper may be summarily rejected at any time the conflict is discovered (including after notification of acceptance). To avoid undeclared conflicts, the author list is considered final after the submission deadline. <strong>No changes to the author list are allowed for accepted papers.</strong> Every paper author should enter their institutional conflict domains in their CMT3 account (click on your name in the upper-right and then “Domain Conflicts” under ICCP 2025). These should include domains of all institutions they have worked for or collaborated closely with within the last 3 years. The primary author should ensure they have added co-authors using the correct email address linked to their CMT3 accounts.</p>
            <p><strong>Double-blind Review:</strong> ICCP reviewing is double-blind in that authors do not know the names of reviewers, and reviewers cannot, beyond a reasonable doubt, infer the authors' names from the submission and the additional material. Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments and supplementary material. Avoid providing links to websites that identify authors. Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review. If you need to cite a different paper of yours that will be under review during the ICCP review period, then either: (1) If a preprint of that paper is available on arXiv, then cite the arXiv version just as you would any work, without suggesting that you are authors of that paper; or (2) cite the paper in your submission without author names, and include an anonymized version with the supplementary material. In either case, you must convincingly argue that your submission is novel compared to the other paper.</p>
            <p><strong>Dual and Concurrent Submissions:</strong> ICCP’s goal is to publish novel, exciting work and to prevent duplication of reviewing effort. By submitting a manuscript to ICCP, authors acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue, including journal, conference, workshop, or archival forum. Furthermore, <strong>no publication substantially similar in content has been or will be submitted to this or another conference, workshop, or journal during the ICCP review period.</strong> Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and will be reported to the other venue to which the submission was sent. A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined as written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection and, after review, was accepted. In particular, this definition of publication does not depend upon whether such an accepted written work appears in formal proceedings or whether the organizers declare that such work “counts as a publication.”</p>
            <p>The above definition <strong>does not consider an arXiv.org paper as a publication</strong> because it cannot be rejected. It also excludes university technical reports, which are typically not peer-reviewed. However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in a proceedings, if their length is more than four pages (excluding citations). Given this definition, any ICCP submission should not overlap substantially with prior publications or other concurrent submissions. A submission with substantial overlap includes one that shares 20 percent or more material, or anything that may be viewed by the reviewers or readers as a “contribution”, with previous or concurrently submitted publications. If there is any possibility that a prior publication or concurrent submissions could be seen as having overlap with the ICCP manuscript, authors should discuss and cite that work (taking care to maintain anonymity as described in the previous section). Authors are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs about clarifications on borderline or unusual cases.</p>
            <p>Note that a technical report (departmental, arXiv.org, etc.) version of the submission that is put up without any form of direct peer review is NOT considered prior art and should NOT be cited in the submission.</p>
            <p><strong>Plagiarism:</strong> Plagiarism consists of appropriating the words or results of another without credit. ICCP 2025’s policy on plagiarism is to refer suspected cases to the IEEE Intellectual Property office, which has an established mechanism for dealing with plagiarism and broad powers of excluding offending authors from future conferences and from IEEE journals. You can find information on this office, their procedures, and their definitions of five levels of plagiarism at <a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/plagiarism.html">this webpage</a>. We will be actively checking for plagiarism. Furthermore, the paper matching system is quite accurate. As a result, it regularly happens that a paper containing plagiarized material goes to a reviewer from whom the material was plagiarized; experience shows that such reviewers pursue plagiarism cases enthusiastically.</p>
            <p><strong>LLM policy:</strong> Authors may use any tools they find productive in preparing a paper, but they are responsible for any misrepresentation, factual inaccuracy, or plagiarism. Papers containing citations of non-existent material will be rejected when found and may be rejected without review. Similarly, papers containing obvious factual inaccuracies will be rejected when found and may be rejected without review. Authors are responsible for what they submit.</p>
