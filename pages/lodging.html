          This airport serves major destinations in the Northeastern US and Canada, as well as Chicago.

          A free shuttle takes passengers to Toronto's Union Station, which is a 10min subway ride from Chelsea Hotel and UofT. 
          Because of its relatively limited incoming/outgoing flights, security checkpoints and Canadian customs processing are very fast and efficient.
