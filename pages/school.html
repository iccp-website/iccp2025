	<h2 class="title">Summer School on Computational Imaging</h2>
	<p class="has-text-justified">The first ICCP Summer School on Computational Imaging will take place July 19&ndash;20, 2025, immediately before the ICCP 2025 main conference, at the University of Toronto. The summer school aims to provide undergraduate and graduate students from around the world the opportunity to attend <em>hands-on</em> courses on current research topics in computational imaging and computational photography.</p>

	<section class="subsection">
		<h3 class="subtitle" id="application">Eligibility and Application Process</h3>

		<p class="has-text-justified">The ICCP 2025 organizing committee will select <strong>25 students</strong> from among eligible applicants to participate in the summer school. Eligible to apply is everyone currently enrolled full-time in an undergraduate or graduate degree program.</p>

		<p class="has-text-justified">To apply to the summer school, please complete the <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerBqIJnJ2rxDaFjLjDISuu0PRkjFYzoTaL3IwqEJMcv7nMjA/viewform?usp=header">online application form</a></strong>. </p>
			
		<p class="has-text-justified">We will start processing applications on <strong>June 3, 23:59 ET</strong>, when we will start sending invitations to successful applicants on a rolling basis. However, we will continue accepting applications until June 31, 23:59 ET, or until all slots are filled.</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle" id="registration">Registration and Visa</h3>

		<p class="has-text-justified">Successful applicants will need to purchase a special registration to participate in the summer school, priced as follows.</p>
		<ul class="has-text-justified">
			<li>Registration for summer school only: <strong>$300 CAD</strong>.</li>
			<li>Registration for summer school and main conference: <strong>$400 CAD</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="has-text-justified">We strongly encourage school applicants that need a visa to enter Canada to <a href="./#registration">register</a> for the main conference as soon as possible (in parallel with their summer school application), so they can be issued visa invitation letters immediately. Unsuccessful applicants that do not plan to attend the main conference will be allowed to request a full refund of their registration until June 31, 2025. Successful applicants that have already registered for the main conference will have to pay only the difference in registration fees, depending on whether they plan to attend the main conference. We will email information on how to register and pay the fee differential to successful applicants with the summer school invitation.</p>

	<section class="subsection">
		<h3 class="subtitle" id="lodging">Lodging and Meals</h3>
		
		<p class="has-text-justified">Students will need to make their own lodging arrangements. We have reserved 25 rooms at the University of Toronto's <a href="https://knoxresidence.utoronto.ca/">Knox residence</a> as an affordable lodging option ($62.15 CAD per night after tax, single rooms with shared dormitory-style washrooms) exclusively for summer school students. Information about how to reserve a room and how to pay for lodging will be emailed to successful applicants with the summer school invitation.</p>
		
		<p class="has-text-justified">We will provide breakfast and lunch during the two days of the summer school days.</p>

	<section class="subsection">
		<h3 class="subtitle" id="aid">Financial Aid</h3>
		
		<p class="has-text-justified">There is considerable financial aid available in the form of grants for travel and lodging costs, and potentially registration waivers. We will email further details to the successful applicants along with the summer school invitation. We will prioritize students that also attend the main conference.</p>

			</figure>
			<p class="has-text-justified">The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) can observe distant black holes through a global network of telescopes. However, EHT measurements are sparse and noisy, requiring computational algorithms to recover a black hole image. The goal of this course is to help students get comfortable with EHT data and image reconstruction algorithms. We will learn how to use the eht-imaging library and diffusion methods to (1) generate synthetic data, (2) reconstruct a synthetic image, and (3) reconstruct an image of the M87 black hole from real EHT data. These steps are a starting point towards more challenging black-hole imaging topics, including polarization, dynamic imaging, and 3D imaging.</p>

			<h4>Build Your Own VR Headset</h4>
			<figure class="course-image">
				<img class="course-teaser" src="./static/img/school/course_vr2.png" alt="Build Your Own VR Headset">
			</figure>
			<p class="has-text-justified">Students will learn about hardware (optics, electronics, display, microcontroller) and software (JavaScript, WebGL, GLSL) aspects of Virtual Reality (VR). The goal of this course is to learn all of these aspects in a hands-on manner. Each student or small team of students will build a fully functional head mounted display (HMD), including optics, display, IMU, rendering, lens distortion shader, model loader, etc., from off-the-shelf parts. The HMD we will build is inspired by the Oculus DK1. We will <em>not</em> learn game development, but we will study and implement the fundamental building blocks of VR systems.</p>

			<h4>Single-Photon Computational Imaging</h4>

				<img class="course-teaser" src="./static/img/school/course_spad2.png" alt="Single-Photon Computational Imaging">
			</figure>
			<p class="has-text-justified">Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerging class of image sensors capable of detecting individual photons, at timing resolutions from picoseconds to nanoseconds. SPAD sensors are commonly used in active imaging applications such as lidar, and are becoming increasingly popular in compelling passive imaging applications. In this course, we provide an introduction to SPADs, how they capture light, their imaging applications, and the hardware trends that are influencing the future outlook of these sensors and research directions in this space. The course includes a strong hands-on component featuring a low-cost ($20) SPAD sensor used for active imaging, and a quarter-megapixel SPAD sensor used for passive imaging.</p>

			<h4>Interferometric Computational Imaging</h4>

				<img class="course-teaser" src="./static/img/school/course_interferometry2.png" alt="Interferometric Computational Imaging">
			</figure>
			<p class="has-text-justified">This course will provide an introduction to interferometry, a classical imaging methodology with applications ranging from retinal scanning in opthalmology, to coherent lidar in autonomous vehicles, and to gravitational wave detection in astronomy. More recently, interferometric computational imaging methods have enabled capabilities such as passive lidar and quadrillion FPS videos. We will learn about the physics of interferometry and coherent imaging, and emerging computational imaging applications. We will also get hands-on experience working with interferometric systems, by building, calibrating, and capturing data with a low-cost interferometer capable of micron-scale 3D scanning.</p>
